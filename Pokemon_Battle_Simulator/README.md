How it works:
 
This is a turn based Pokemon battle simulator. The user first enters one of the original 151 Pokemon to use in battle against a randomly generated computer opponent. The user can then choose to attack the opponent, use a potion, try capturing the opponent with a Pokeball, check the statistics of both the user and the opponent, or run away from the battle.

The battle ends in one of four ways. The battle ends when either Pokemon faints. It can also if the user captures the wild Pokemon by using a Pokeball. The odds of catching the wild Pokemon increase as the opponent'€™s health decreases. The wild Pokemon also has a 5 percent chance of running away from the battle in each of their turns. The user can also choose to run away from the battle.

To keep the battle relatively fair, the levels of the Pokemon are randomly generated between levels 40 and 60. 

I've included the code in both .py format to be run from the command line or .ipynb format to be run from Jupyter Notebook. The preferred method is to run it using the .ipynb file from Jupyter Notebook. This is because the images wonâ€™t show up if run from the command line.

This script is meant to be run with all the csv files and images from the working directory. Copy the folder Pokemon_Battle_Simulator and its contents anywhere and it will work.

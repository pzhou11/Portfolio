                <p>Our goal is to use advances in wearable technology to augment player fitness and team formation training for youth soccer. In this webpage, we hope to demonstrate innovative ways in which soccer coaches and players can visualize their fitness and team spacing.
                    <br>The fitness visualizations could provide coaches with information regarding energy expenditure, speed, and distance ran throughout the course of a match. This provides an opportunity for coaches to personalize the training to the strength and weaknesses of each player and see their progress over the course of the season. This also provides coaches with a tool for possible overuse injury prevention by comparing across different matches to hopefully catch fatigue issues.
                    <br>The team analysis gives the coach a great tool to quickly visualize their team positioning and spacing throughout a match. This type of information was previously unavailable to coaches without having to watch hours of game tape.
                </p>

                <h1 class="page-header">Data</h1>
                <p>For this project we used data captured from 2 games in 2013 at Alfheim Stadium for the Norwegian professional football team, Troms√∏ IL. Even though this dataset is only from 2 matches, we seek to show the possibilites for this type of technology as it becomes widely adapted and open datasets become available.
